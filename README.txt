Welcome to my Final Year Project :)

To start the server please type "npm start" into the command line, open your browser and type "http://localhost:3000" this will bring you to the 
application. A deployed version is available at https://dinms.herokuapp.com but there is a bug with adding ingredients to the restock order, this
bug is not present in the local version.
